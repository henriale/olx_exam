## About the exam
Wasn't provided any deadline, so I took about 10 hours to build a basic framework
and, if you find necessary, we can discuss about the improvements and I show the better solution in my opinion.

#### What's missing?
- Middlewares - One of the most important features the framework should have. it would, however, take a little longer
- Environment variables - Useful for scalability
- API Authentication & throttling
- Events - I am an adept of Event Driven Development, but it was out this time
- Exporting modules to separated packages
- Docker Deployment - It's a really modern tool but I haven't learned yet
- Database Migration
- The file uploading - I run out of time before implementing it

#### What was done?
- Resource routing from scratch
- Application Kernel from scratch
- Structure based on modularization
- Basic modeling class

## API
- GET users - show all users
- GET users/:id - show specific user
- PUT users/:id - update specific user
- DELETE users/:id - update specific user

##### The framework was inspired in:
- Laravel
- Lumen
- Symfony
- Phalcon
- Slim
- Express JS
